## Why obsidian?

## Why hugo?

- Publish on github pages
- Easier to setup than jekyll

## Two repositories

- One for all files that are needed to generate the blog 
  - minus template, pictures and the actual markdown files

## The way  obsidian references images

- Central attachmetn folder
- How to make this work with hugo?
- First in your posts always refer to the static folder 
- Use default markdown linking syntax

```markdown
![Some file](/static/somefile.png)
```

- configure hugo to look for the static files in the same place by adding this to the config (if the folder is not called "static")

```toml
[[module.mounts]] 
source = "static" 
target = "attachments"
```

## The way I want to maintain by blog posts and static fils

I dont want any clutter in my obsidian and I lke the idea of having my blog posts separately from the static site generator

- using git submodules

```bash
git submodule add -b mother https://github.com/manualbashing/posts.git content/post
git submodule add -b mother https://github.com/manualbashing/posts.git static
```

- this will checkout both folders in both location, which is not what we want

```bash
git submodule update --recursive --remote --init
cd ./content/post
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter posts -f
cd ../../static
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter static -f
```

this updates posts and static files and I can have a look at my new posts with `hugo serve`

## Makes this work on github

This is done with a github actions workflow

#action/üïµüèª  Maybe this can also be done with going to each folder and pulling with the `--directory-fiter`
