title: "Issues with Terraform and WSL: Unable to list provider registration status"

## The problem

Today, something weird happened when I was using terraform in my WSL2 to deploy some infrastructure to Azure. I was initializing terraform, typed:

```bash
terraform plan
```

And... nothing happened.

After waiting a small eternity the following error popped up on my console:

> **Error: Unable to list provider registration status; it is possible that this is due to invalid credentials or the service principal does not have permission to use the Resource Manager API**, Azure error: resources. ProvidersClient#List: Failure sending request: StatusCode=0 -- Original Error: Get "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx/providers?api-version=2016-02-01%22:" dial tcp: lookup management.azure.com on 172.23.224.1:53: **cannot unmarshal DNS message**

## The cause

What was going on? Apparently, `azurerm`   (Terraform's provider for Azure Resource Manager) tried to resolve the hostname `management.azure.com` and was not happy with the response.

After some excessive googling and GitHub-issue browsing, I finally hit gold: [net: 512 byte DNS response size limit causes an error when making requests to Azure on WSL2 ¬∑ Issue #51127 ¬∑ golang/go (github.com)](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51127#issue-1129393515)

The azurerm provider was written in Golang, and apparently, Golang's net/dns resolver applies a strict 512-byte limit to the response buffer. If the response exceeds that limit, the resolver will not be able to "unmarshal the DNS message".

A quick `dig` affirmed all suspicions:

```bash

```

Indeed, the response size was 632 bytes. **But why did it work in the past?** According to AaronFriel (see link above), Microsoft only recently added additional cnames to their management.azure.com endpoint, pushing the response size over the 512-byte limit.

**Why is this happening only in WSL2?** Per default, WSL2 uses the DNS configuration of the Hyper-V Virtual Network Adapter. This DNS server adds additional data to the ANSWER section of the response: [DNS server mixes AUTHORITY/ADDITIONAL section into ANSWER section while responding to queries ¬∑ Issue #5806 ¬∑ microsoft/WSL (github.com)](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5806)

## The workaround

What worked for me was forcing WSL2 to use an external DNS resolver like Google (`8.8.8.8`) or UltraDNS (`64.6.64.6`):

```bash
‚ùØ dig management.azure.com @64.6.64.6

```

That brought the response down to a size the resolver in Golang could digest.

The DNS server in WSL2 is configured in the `/etc/resolv.conf`, which WSL2 generates on every boot. Changing anything here will not persist.

You first need to tell WSL2 not to touch the file. Add the following to `/etc/wsl.conf` (if the file does not exist, feel free to create it):

```bash
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
```

Now restart your WSL2 by typing `wsl.exe --shutdown`  in the cmd command prompt. After WSL2 has started again, remove the sad remains of  `/etc/resolv.conf` (it is a symlink now, that does not point anywhere anymore):

```bash
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
```

Now add an external nameserver of your choice to the file:

```bash
 echo 'nameserver 64.6.64.6' | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf
```

And that's it! After this change, terraform worked again in WSL2.
