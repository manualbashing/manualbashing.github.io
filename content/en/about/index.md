Hi there, I'm Manuel. I currently work as an Application Developer, Cloud Solution Architect and DevOps Engineer at [abtis GmbH](https://abtis.de) in Pforzheim, Germany. 

This blog is my irregularly updated public notebook of bits and pieces of knowledge that I find interesting or useful in the work that I do.

You can find me also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manualbashing).
