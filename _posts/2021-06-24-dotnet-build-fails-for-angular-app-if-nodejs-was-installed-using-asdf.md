title:  "dotnet build fails for Angular app if Node.js was installed using asdf"

I was creating a new angular project using a template via [dotnet cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) today:

```bash
dotnet new angular
```

Id did not have Node.js installed so I installed it using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/):

```bash
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf install nodejs latest
```

This successfully installed Node.js `v16.4.0`. But when I tried to build the example project using `dotnet build` I ran into the following error:

```bash
‚ùØ dotnet build

```

No version set for command `node`?  That error is produced by the shim that asdf creates for the node executable. Apparently it needs to know explicitly which version of Node.js should be used in the current project. 

That can be done by creating a file named `.tool-versions` in the project root and adding the Node.js version that should be used. Im my case the content of this file looked like this:

```text
nodejs 16.4.0
```

After creating this file the `dotnet build` command executed without any issues.

You can learn more about the `.tool-versions` configuration file here: [Configuration (asdf-vm.com)](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-configuration?id=tool-versions)
