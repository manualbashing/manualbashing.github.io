I was initializing terraform, typed:
terraform plan And&amp;hellip; nothing happened.
After waiting a small eternity the following error popped up on my console:
Error: Unable to list provider registration status; it is possible that this is due to invalid credentials or the service principal does not have permission to use the Resource Manager API, Azure error: resources.</description></item><item><title>Use PowerShell to sort version strings</title><link>https://manualbashing.github.io/post/2022-02-14-sort-version-strings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 12:50:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manualbashing.github.io/post/2022-02-14-sort-version-strings/</guid><description>When sorting or comparing version numbers in PowerShell (to determine the latest version of a release, etc.), be careful not to work with plain version strings.
PowerShell sorts strings in a lexical way, which means that it compares strings character by character to determine the sort order. This works well for words: fool will come after foo but before fox. This does not work well for version strings:
❯ &amp;#39;1.0.0&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;0.</description></item><item><title>How to restore or purge a soft-deleted Azure API management service instance</title><link>https://manualbashing.github.io/post/2022-02-10-soft-deleted-apim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://manualbashing.github.io/post/2022-02-10-soft-deleted-apim/</guid><description>Starting with REST API version, 2020-06-01-preview , Microsoft introduced the soft-delete feature to API Management service (APIM) (See: Azure API Management soft-delete (preview) | Microsoft Docs)
Deleting an APIM using the REST API version 2020-06-01-preview or higher will not obliterate the service but put it into the soft-delete state. It can be restored or purged (deleted forever) from this state. If nothing is done, the APIM will purge itself after a specific time.</description></item><item><title>dotnet build would fail for an angular app if nodejs were installed using asdf</title><link>https://manualbashing.github.io/post/2021-06-24-dotnet-build-fails-for-angular-app-if-nodejs-was-installed-using-asdf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://manualbashing.github.io/post/2021-06-24-dotnet-build-fails-for-angular-app-if-nodejs-was-installed-using-asdf/</guid><description>I was creating a new angular project using a template via dotnet cli today:
